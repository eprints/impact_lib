# impact_lib

The Impact Flavour is designed to offer research impact capturing abilities for EPrints.
It is designed to be used with EPrints 3.4.

These files should be placed within the EPrints flavours directory, typically
  /opt/eprints3/flavours/impact_lib 

The flavour can be used by creating a repository with
  /opt/eprints3/bin/epadmin create impact

The Impact Flavour was produced by EPrints Services and The University of Glasgow.

Our thanks go to Michael Eadie and William Nixon.
